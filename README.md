# espresso-ui-test

In this project, i'm going to demonstrate android ui / instrumentation testing
with Espresso.

Using Tests Suites, you can bundle up multiple tests classes and run them all at once

Things to test for.
1. Launch MainActivity
2. Confirm Activity looks the way it should:
    Eg- Title is correct, next button exists
3. Activity Navigation Test
4. Using Test Suites
5. Firebase Test Labs
6. Testing Fragments
7. Testing Fragments Navigation (Old way with support fragment manager)
8. Gallery Intents and startActivityForResult - using the espresso-intent dependency
9. Testing Camera Intents, Custom Drawable Matcher
10. Testing Dialogs and Toasts Message
11.
